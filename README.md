# Vaughn and Charlie's Pi in the Sky

## The Plan

### The Rough Idea
Our plan is to create a foam version of a clay pigeon, the houses a raspberry pi with an accelerometer to take measurements and then be recovered. Once through with measurements, we will paint the sky with the blood of the pi. 

### Expected Materials and Costs

| Item  | Source | Cost |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Raspberry Pi Zero W  | Sigma Lab  | $10.00  |
| LSM303DLHC Accelerometer  | Sigma Lab  | $7.95  |
| LP803860 LiPo Battery | Sigma Lab | $12.50 |
| PowerBoost 500 Charger | Sigma Lab | $14.95 |
| Clay Pigeons | Field and Stream | $10.00 | 

### Projected Issues
One of the biggest issues that we project is the size and shape of the clay pigeon related to our foam replica. Because ideally we would like to shoot one off into the sky to gather our measurements, the size and shape must be accurate to the real thing in order to launch it using the same mechanisms. This is difficult due to how small the pigeon is. Because we are creating a PCB to mount the components on, that may help us with our size concern. 

### Project Schedule Estimate

# Week of 8/26/2019
Planning period - Researching costs, materials needed, and planning out the project ahead for optimal results. During this time we will try to source some of the prototyping materials that we need. Aditionally, design will be started on the PCB.
# Week of 9/2/2019
Continue design on PCB, and try to get all wiring components working together and recieving data. Charlie will be testing out ideas with foam and silicone.
# Week of 9/9/2019
Field test with raw components in a foam football of some sorts. At this point hopefully start doing real tests on printing the PCB, and taking silicone castings of the clay pigeons.
