# Vaughn and Charlie's Pi in the Sky

## The Plan

### The Rough Idea
Our plan is to create a foam version of a clay pigeon, which houses a raspberry pi with an accelerometer. We are going to create the foam clay pigeon by making a silicon mold of a normal clay pigeon first, and then using an expanding foam to fill the mold. We want to make the clay pigeon out of foam so the pi will stay safe during the first flight and be able to take measurements and be recovered. Also creating a silicon mold sounds fun and interesting. Once through with measurements, we will launch the pi a second time and blow it out of the sky. 

### Expected Materials and Costs

| Item  | Source | Cost |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Raspberry Pi Zero W  | Sigma Lab  | $10.00  |
| LSM303DLHC Accelerometer  | Sigma Lab  | $7.95  |
| LP803860 LiPo Battery | Sigma Lab | $12.50 |
| PowerBoost 500 Charger | Sigma Lab | $14.95 |
| Clay Pigeons | Field and Stream | $10.00 |
| Box to create mold | Charlie's house | $0 |
| Silicon Mold Kit | Amazon | ≈$35 |
| Expanding foam | Amazon | ≈$35 |

### Projected Issues
One of the biggest issues that we project is the size and shape of the clay pigeon related to our foam replica. Because ideally we would like to shoot one off into the sky to gather our measurements, the size and shape must be accurate to the real thing in order to launch it using the same mechanisms. This is difficult due to how small the pigeon is and it's shape. Even the small components we need to add may affect the pigeons flight. Because we are creating a PCB to mount the components on, that may help us with our size concern. 

## Project Schedule Estimate

### Week of 8/26/2019
Planning period - Researching costs, materials needed, and planning out the project ahead for optimal results. During this time we will try to source some of the prototyping materials that we need. Aditionally, design will be started on the PCB.
### Week of 9/2/2019
Continue design on PCB, and try to get all wiring components working together and recieving data. Charlie will be testing out ideas with foam and silicone.
### Week of 9/9/2019
Field test with raw components in a foam football of some sorts. At this point hopefully start doing real tests on printing the PCB, and taking silicone castings of the clay pigeons.

## Weekly Updates

### Week of 8/26/2019
This week we are finishing up our writeup of this plan on Github, and working on getting materials for our project. So far, we have purchased clay pigeons from Field and Stream, and Charlie is working on creating a box around the pigeon to hold the mold. Vaughn is setting up the pi and is going to start work on a custom PCB soon.
